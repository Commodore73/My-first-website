    <p>Actor, Producer, Writer    </p>  






<p>I am a real, relatable and reliable actor/writer based in Greater Manchester. I enjoy improvisation and am confident in role play scenarios too. I have built up acting experience in theatre, short film, feature film, TV, role play and have also performed in corporate training videos and commercials.</p>

<p>I am due to appear in this year's Greater Manchester Fringe festival in the "Ladies that Monologue" project. I am also co-producing this production that will showcase women over 40, Northern voices and new writing.</p>
